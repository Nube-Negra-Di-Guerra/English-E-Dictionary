            <br>
            At 21 years old, I built, developed, configured, and deployed this Dictionary. I realised I could and that it would be a crime not to do it, I inspired by all the documentaries and stories of achievements from young people in the past. <br> <br> I always disliked waiting for something to finally happen by magic so to be proud of it, <br> and this is an example something, amongst many more, I would mention with enthusiasm in a conversation with a colleague or a friend.

            This dictionary is a free resource, created with the aim of helping users better understand English words. It provides definitions of words, and while it does not include phonetic transcriptions, it offers a simple and easy-to-use interface.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please note that this dictionary may not cover all English words and may not be suitable for users seeking a very advanced vocabulary experience. We hope you find this dictionary useful and welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
